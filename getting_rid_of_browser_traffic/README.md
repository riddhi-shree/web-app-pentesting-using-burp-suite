[< Back](../README.md)

1. Do you see unnecessary traffic in your site map? Are they originating from Firefox browser itself? We need to get rid of these noise.

2. To disable capturing of unnecessary browser traffic, analyze the traffic in the "Site map" and identify URL patterns that need to be excluded. In the current scenario, we observe that most of the noise is originating from following two domains:
    * `firefox.com`
    * `mozilla.com`

3. In your Firefox browser, click on "FoxyProxy" icon and select "__Options__"

5. In the "Add/Edit Patterns for localhost-8080" window, click on "__New Black__" button, and edit the "Name" and "Pattern" fields as shown below:
    * __1st Black Pattern__:
        * Name: `firefox.com`
        * Pattern: `*.firefox.com`
    * __2nd Black Pattern__:
        * Name: `mozilla.com`
        * Pattern: `*.mozilla.com`

8. Also, disable following browser configurations by accessing `about:config` in the address bar of your Firefox browser.

    - `browser.urlbar.autoFill.typed`
